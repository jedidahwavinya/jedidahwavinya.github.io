## ðŸ¤– Project #1 â€“ Demand Prediction of Driver Availability (Multistep Time Series)

**Overview:**  
My **first** machine learning project, where I **simulated a dataset** (generated in Python) to predict driver availability in specific areas using **multistep time series analysis**.

**Objective:**  
- Predict driver availability over multiple future time steps.  
- Provide actionable insights for ride-hailing or logistics platforms to balance supply and demand.

**Use Case:**  
Helps ride-hailing services (e.g., Faras, Uber, Bolt) and logistics companies optimize driver allocation, reduce wait times, and improve service efficiency.

**Key Tasks:**  
- Simulated realistic driver availability data.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand temporal trends.  
- Built and evaluated multistep time series forecasting models.  
- Visualized predicted vs. actual availability for model validation.

**Tools & Techniques:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- Time series modeling techniques  
- Supervised learning approach for forecasting

## ðŸ“Š Project #2 - Linear Regression Model â€“ Data Science Mini Project

This project explores the basics of **linear regression** using Python and Scikit-learn.
It demonstrates the complete data science workflow:

- âœ… Loaded and explored the dataset using visual tools like scatter plots  
- âœ… Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- âœ… Split the data into training and test sets  
- âœ… Built a linear regression model  
- âœ… Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE and MSE  
- âœ… Visualized predictions to interpret model accuracy

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning and data preprocessing.
