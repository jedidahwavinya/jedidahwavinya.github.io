## 👋 Hey there! I'm Jedidah Wavinya 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where code meets creativity, and passion meets purpose.

I'm a **Mathematics & Computer Science** graduate, a tech enthusiast, and a curious mind who finds joy in building, analyzing, and solving real-world problems with the power of technology.

### 🌱 What I Do

* 💻 **Code & Build** — I enjoy working with Python, Java (Android Studio), HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript to create useful and beautiful things.
* 📊 **Analyze & Understand** — Data fascinates me. From Excel to Pandas, I love turning messy data into meaningful insights.
* 📣 **Market & Connect** — I’ve also dipped my toes into digital marketing, helping brands build their presence through content, SEO, and strategy.

### 🛠 Projects I'm Proud Of

* **Titanic Data Analysis (Kaggle)** – Explored survival data using Python and visualized insights.
* **My Portfolio Website** – Yep, this one! Built with GitHub Pages + Jekyll, styled to reflect me.
* **Android Task App** – A simple mobile app that helped me fall in love with Java.

### 💡 I Believe In...

* Lifelong learning 📚
* Creative problem-solving ✨
* The power of community and collaboration 🤝
* Clean code and cleaner designs 🎨

### 🌍 Beyond Tech...

When I'm not coding, I’m probably making handmade mats, taking aesthetic photos, experimenting with hair, or sharing bits of my journey as a young woman of faith.
