## 📊 Linear Regression Model – Data Science Mini Project

This project explores the basics of **linear regression** using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow:

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using visual tools like scatter plots  
- ✅ Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- ✅ Split the data into training and test sets  
- ✅ Built a linear regression model  
- ✅ Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE and MSE  
- ✅ Visualized predictions to interpret model accuracy

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning and data preprocessing.

## 🧠 Supervised Machine Learning Classification Project

In this project, I applied my understanding of supervised machine learning classification by building and evaluating multiple models using the **Wine dataset** from Scikit-learn. The key steps included:

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships and class distributions.
- 🧪 **Data Splitting** into training and test sets for proper model evaluation.
- 🤖 **Model Training** on six classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- 🏆 **Model Comparison** to identify the best-performing algorithm based on test results.

> 📌 **Goal:** To compare the effectiveness of different classification algorithms and interpret which model performs best and why.

# 🛠️ MLOps Regression Pipeline with FastAPI

This project showcases a complete MLOps workflow where I built, tuned, evaluated, and deployed a regression model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The goal was to apply best practices in machine learning engineering to create a scalable, reproducible, and production-ready model pipeline.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and standardized the dataset using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Trained a `KNeighborsRegressor` with hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Used R² Score and 5-fold cross-validation to assess performance
- 🧪 **Model Persistence**: Saved the trained model with `joblib` for reuse
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Exposed the model as a REST API using `FastAPI` and tested it locally with `Uvicorn`

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, FastAPI, Uvicorn, joblib, GridSearchCV, Pydanti
