## 📊 Linear Regression Model – Data Science Mini Project

This project explores the basics of **linear regression** using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow:

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using visual tools like scatter plots  
- ✅ Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- ✅ Split the data into training and test sets  
- ✅ Built a linear regression model  
- ✅ Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE and MSE  
- ✅ Visualized predictions to interpret model accuracy

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning and data preprocessing.

## 🧠 Supervised Machine Learning Classification Project

In this project, I applied my understanding of supervised machine learning classification by building and evaluating multiple models using the **Wine dataset** from Scikit-learn. The key steps included:

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships and class distributions.
- 🧪 **Data Splitting** into training and test sets for proper model evaluation.
- 🤖 **Model Training** on six classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- 🏆 **Model Comparison** to identify the best-performing algorithm based on test results.

> 📌 **Goal:** To compare the effectiveness of different classification algorithms and interpret which model performs best and why.
