## 📊 Linear Regression Model – Data Science Mini Project

This project explores the basics of **linear regression** using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow:

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using visual tools like scatter plots  
- ✅ Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- ✅ Split the data into training and test sets  
- ✅ Built a linear regression model  
- ✅ Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE and MSE  
- ✅ Visualized predictions to interpret model accuracy

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning and data preprocessing.

## 🍷 Wine Classification using Supervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates my understanding of **supervised machine learning classification** models using the classic **Wine dataset** from Scikit-learn. The goal is to explore the data, visualize key patterns, train multiple classifiers, and compare their performance to determine the most effective model.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Wine Dataset (Scikit-learn)
- **Type**: Supervised Classification
- **Target**: Predict wine class (0, 1, or 2) based on chemical features

## 📊 Models Implemented

Six different classification algorithms were trained and evaluated:

- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- 🌳 Decision Tree  
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- 👥 k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🧮 Naive Bayes  
- ➗ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧪 Key Tasks Performed

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships and class distributions
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets
- Built and trained all six models using **Scikit-learn**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- Compared results to determine the **best-performing model**

## 📈 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Conclusion

After analyzing the evaluation metrics across all models, I was able to determine which model generalized best on unseen data and offered the best balance of precision and recall. This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of classification algorithms and model evaluation techniques.
