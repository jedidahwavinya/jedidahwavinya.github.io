## 📊 Linear Regression Model – Data Science Mini Project

This project explores the basics of **linear regression** using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow:

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using visual tools like scatter plots  
- ✅ Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- ✅ Split the data into training and test sets  
- ✅ Built a linear regression model  
- ✅ Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE and MSE  
- ✅ Visualized predictions to interpret model accuracy

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my understanding of supervised machine learning and data preprocessing.
