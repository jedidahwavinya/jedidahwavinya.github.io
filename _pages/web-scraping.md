## 🕸️ Web Scraping Project #1 – "Scrape Site" Forms Page

**Overview:**  
This was my **first** hands-on web scraping project, where I set out to build a Python-based solution capable of **navigating a webpage**, **extracting structured table data**, and saving it into a clean, analysis-ready spreadsheet.  

**Project Highlights:**  
- 🌐 **Target Site:** [Scrape This Site – Forms Page](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/)  
- 🚀 **Why It’s Special:** My entry point into web scraping — this project gave me the foundational skills I later applied to more advanced scraping tasks.  
- 🔍 **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Navigating multi-page form-based sites.  
  - Extracting tabular data with **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests**.  
  - Automating **pagination** to capture full datasets.  
  - Cleaning & structuring data before export.  
  - Saving clean datasets to **Excel/CSV** format.  
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**  
  - Python  
  - BeautifulSoup4  
  - Requests  
  - Pandas  

**Workflow Overview:**  
1. **Navigate the Page:** Load HTML structure via HTTP requests.  
2. **Extract Table Data:** Identify and retrieve team stats from HTML tables.  
3. **Handle Pagination:** Loop through multiple result pages automatically.  
4. **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies for uniform formatting.  
5. **Save Results:** Export final dataset to CSV/Excel for further analysis.
